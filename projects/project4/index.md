Purnota Foundation team and our collaborative field partners are happy to inform you that we have
began work on 5 more tube wells! PF-003 and PF-004 is being built in Gazipur with the help of Smile-Secret of your happiness youth foundation. PF-005 is being built in Kishoreganj with the help of তারুণ্যের আহবানেে, who also helped build the first two. Additionally,বিন্যাস ফাউন্ডেশনেশন is helping us build PF-006 in Lalmonirhaat. FinallBangladesh Socio-Cultural Forum - BSCF, Rajshahiahi is helping us build PF-007 in Rajshahi.

These tube wells are being built as a part of our initiative, Project স্বচ্ছতা, which aimed to build
at least 10 tube wells for families and communities in need! Thank you to all of our partner organizations for providing us with the on field assistance, our volunteers for their hard work, and our supporters who make our goals possible!

There are still 5 days for you to contribute to this cause! While we have enough funding to build
the 10 tube-well, we would like to expand to at least 15 if possible. Work is being done actively
and although we wanted to finish it all within ramadan, due to unavailability of labors and ensuring quality of work, some of them will be built during next month. As we prepare to close fundraising for the project, we encourage you to capitalize on the opportunity to be part of such an initiative in the month of Ramadan. Any donation amount goes a long way for us and certainly has an impact.
